## TITLE OF PROJECT - Sakila DVD Rental database

## DESCRIPTION
> The Sakila Database holds information about a company that rents movie DVDs. For this project, I will be querying the database to gain an understanding of the customer base, such as what the patterns in movie watching are across different customer groups, how they compare on payment earnings, and how the stores compare in their performance.
Note: One quirk you may notice about the database is that the rental dates are all from 2005 and 2006, while the payment dates are all from 2007.

## SOFTWARES USED 
> Postgresql

## FILES USED
>dvdrental.tar

> The project submission is a presentation.For the presentation component, I created four slides. Each slide has:
    1. Question of interest.
    2. Supporting SQL query needed to answer the question.
    3. Supporting visualization created using the final data of your SQL query that answers your question of interest.
